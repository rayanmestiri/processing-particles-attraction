Particles Attraction In Processing

I tried to recreate the work of Hybrid Visuals called <a href="http://www.hybridvisuals.nl/projects/take-me-for-one-more-wave/">"One More Wave"</a>.

I used the example of <a href="http://toxiclibs.org">Toxiclibs</a> as a basis.

Thanks to the original developer that helped me getting started.
